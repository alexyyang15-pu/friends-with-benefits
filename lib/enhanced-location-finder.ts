  const enhancedPrompt = `You are a location intelligence expert. Find the PERSONAL/RESIDENTIAL location of ${connection['First Name']} ${connection['Last Name']}, who works as ${connection.Position} at ${connection.Company}.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. ONLY return their personal/residential location where they actually live
2. DO NOT use company headquarters or office locations
3. DO NOT guess or infer locations based on company location
4. Look for specific personal indicators in public profiles

SEARCH STRATEGY:
üîç PRIMARY SOURCES (in order of priority):
   1. LinkedIn profile location field (personal residence)
   2. Twitter/X bio location 
   3. Personal website or blog mentions
   4. Conference speaker bios with personal location
   5. News articles mentioning where they live
   6. University alumni directories with current location
   7. Personal social media posts mentioning location

üö´ EXPLICITLY AVOID:
   - Company office locations
   - Corporate headquarters
   - Business addresses
   - General "Bay Area" or "Greater [City] Area" (unless that's their specific personal location)
   - Industry hub assumptions (e.g., "tech = San Francisco")

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- If you find their PERSONAL location: Return exact format "City, State/Country" (e.g., "Austin, TX", "Toronto, Canada", "London, UK")
- If they mention "Remote" or "Working remotely from [City]": Return the city they're remote from
- If no personal location found: Return "Personal location not found"

QUALITY STANDARDS:
‚úÖ GOOD: "Seattle, WA" (they live in Seattle)
‚úÖ GOOD: "Austin, TX" (moved to Austin, working remotely)
‚úÖ GOOD: "London, UK" (personal residence in London)
‚ùå BAD: "San Francisco, CA" (just because they work at a SF tech company)
‚ùå BAD: "New York, NY" (just because company has NYC office)
‚ùå BAD: "Cupertino, CA" (just because they work at Apple)

Remember: We want to know where ${connection['First Name']} ${connection['Last Name']} actually LIVES, not where they work.`;

Name: ${connection['First Name']} ${connection['Last Name']}
Company: ${connection.Company}

2. Entertainment industry professionals (often LA/NYC)
3. Financial services (often NYC/London/Hong Kong)
4. Government/Policy roles (often DC)
5. Academic/Research positions (university towns)

STRICT RULES:
- Only suggest a location if there's a >80% probability based on industry/role specifics
- Do NOT suggest general tech hubs for regular tech workers
- Do NOT use company headquarters
- Be very conservative with suggestions

Response format:
- If confident industry pattern exists: "City, State/Country"  
- If no clear pattern: "No industry pattern"

- "Los Angeles, CA" (for movie studio executive)
- "Washington, DC" (for federal government role)
